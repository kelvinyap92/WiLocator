// Go to git hub, somewhere in the middle-right hand side of the
// page with your repo is the url to use. Go to the directory
// you want your project folder to be in

// This creates the folder, all up to date
git clone "myurl"

// Now you need to cd into just the one project folder that was created.
// don't worry about the ones inside it

// Now in eclipse, change the workspace to WhateverPath/the_folder_that_was_created_after_clone
// If the project doesn't show up, go to import, general, existing project, then get the 
// Project selected, hit ok
// Now make changes to the project

// After you are done, add your changes
git add -A // -A is just changes, * would be everything

// Then you need to commit your changes
git commit -a -m "My message" // With the quotes this time

// -a is all, -m is a message

// Before you push, you should get other peoples changes
// first to avoid conflict
git pull

// Then you can commit your changes
git push origin master

// Now go to your eclipse project and refresh
// If there is ever a problem with your peoject, just delete the folder and re-clone
